    "description": "This project was initiated by my jealously of the Spotify wrapped website. That site is fantastic, It’s a perfect combination of data and arts. Then I started to pitch some ideas on top of that concept. I found that my country Indonesia has an enormous amount of native languages. That got my mind thinking on how about making an exploratory site which presents these languages in a map and shows where are they originally from and spoken. The idea was how to present these maps and languages as if they were on a museum, and I also wanted to give people an experience of walking in a museum and letting them to find interesting places and languages in Indonesia to wonder about. I made Bahasa Gallery. Bahasa means language in Indonesia, I find the word Gallery was the most catchiest word for representing a museum or an exhibit at that moment. It took me almost 2 years working on this project. I changed the design quite a lot, I got to deal with the technical implementation of the design concepts I had. There were lots of hurdles. I went really hard on placing objects in the threejs coordinate system, effects, basic shaders, animations, and coordinating states between transitions. It was super challenging!",

    "description": "I worked on this project in 2017. This project was hugely inspired by visual essays made by pudding.cool who was polygraph at that time if I remember correctly. And I saw there was an essay about hip hop vocabularies and I was fascinated by it, and I wanted to make something like it. then I started to take a look at the trending list in my country and our president was the most popular figure at that moment. The I looked at his twitter account and scrolled down his timeline, tried to find something interesting and I thought to myself what are the things he likes to talk about in his tweets. I immediately fired up my Jupiter notebook and scrapped his tweets in my local computer. I wish I could have a machine learning method to extract topics from his tweets but I wanted to do it in a very simple way. Then I arrived to an idea of finding topics by looking at his words usage. It was a really fun project, I got to look at many data visualization and pull some inspirations from them.",

I got to a new job working with Vue and I was a little left out from react updates, and there were new react features that I missed like hooks and suspense. React suspense was at the early the development and I thought maybe I could leave it for a moment and come back to it later, but react hook was really intriguing. I really wanted to learn it. Then I found a beautiful animation work in dribbble. It was a very complex animation, I got to deal with complex animation states and transitions.",

Shapefiles are just too big for web browsers, I don’t want users to pull lots of megabytes of files just to see the map of Indonesia. Then I worked on making the topojson files of Indonesia and put them on a GitHub repository. I was lucky that I found tools like ndjson-cli and mapshaper, I could make those topojson files very thin without sacrificing the details of the map",
