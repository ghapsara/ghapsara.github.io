I’m a guy currently living in Jakarta. I love working on creative things, and I find that software engineering is the creative field that I like to spend my time the most. I’ve been writing code since 2016.

In 2019, I found myself intrigued with infrastructure engineering. I’m so lucky that I have an opportunity to work and explore my fascinations on the infrastructure engineering along side with tools like kubernetes, docker, gitlab, ci/cd, google infrastucture stacks, ansible, and terraform.

I’m currently working in a team who’s responsible for maintaining scripts written in bash, shell script, python and golang and tools like gitlab, and ansible for microservices deployments. And not limited to that, I also get involved on non technical parts like writing documentations, helping folks from product engineering teams, and joining discussions related infrastructure and software engineering topics.

Previously I was a front end dude. I have 3 years of web development experiences where I built front end apps with widely popular web development stacks such as React, Vue, D3Js, Threejs, and RxJs. I also love working on gathering insights from data. Tools and libraries like Jupyter notebook, pandas, numpy are my favorite weapons when it comes to deal with data. And I still love front end and data, I still use some of my spare time to work, design and write web apps and data projects.

If you're intersted with the projects I've worked on, please head to the [projects](/projects) page, you may find something interesting there.

I promise I would share my learning journey and my thoughts on infrastructure and software engineering on this website, so please stay tuned.

Don’t hesitate to have chats and share your thoughts with me. You can find me on twitter [@guruhhapsara](https://twitter.com/guruhhapsara) or email [guruhhapsara@gmail.com](mailto:guruhhapsara@gmail.com).
