Hi there, I'm Guruh Hapsara. 

I'm very passionate about software engineering. I deeply value delivery, collaboration and creativity.

I like writing, I journal my experiences, projects, learnings, and stuffs I'm excited about. 
I always fully immerse myself in arts. I put my best efforts to render and paint color my thoughts in words on my blog.
